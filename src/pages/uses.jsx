            <Tool title="16” HP Pavillion 16, 32GB RAM (2022)">
              I was using an Intel-based 16” MacBook Pro prior to this and the
              difference is night and day. I’ve never heard the fans turn on a
              single time, even under the incredibly heavy loads I put it
              through with our various launch simulations.
            </Tool>
            <Tool title="MSI Display XDR (Standard Glass)">
              The only display on the market if you want something HiDPI and
              bigger than 27”. When you’re working at planetary scale, every
              pixel you can get counts.
            </Tool>
            <Tool title="Evofox Mechanical Keyboard">
              They don’t make keyboards the way they used to. I buy these any
              time I see them go up for sale and keep them in storage in case I
              need parts or need to retire my main.

          <ToolsSection title="Development tools">
            <Tool title="VS Code">
              I don’t care if it’s missing all of the fancy IDE features
              everyone else relies on, VS code is still the best text
              editor ever made.

            <Tool title="Figma">
              We started using Figma as just a design tool but now it’s become
              our virtual whiteboard for the entire company. Never would have
              expected the collaboration features to be the real hook.
